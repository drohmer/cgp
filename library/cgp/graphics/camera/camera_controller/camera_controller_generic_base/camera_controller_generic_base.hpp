{
	// A generic (empty) camera controller.
	//   The camera controller is set to provide a mapping between mouse/keyboard action onto the camera of the scene
	//   This mapping is set with the action functions:
	//     - action_mouse_move - called when the mouse is moved
	//     - action_keyboard - called when a keyboard touch is pressed/released
	//     - action_mouse_click - called when a mouse button is pressed/released
	//     - idle_frame - called at any frame (ex. for camera animation)
	//   This class and these functions can be specialized in derived controller class for specific behavior.
	//
	//  Technical details:
	//    The camera controller has access to the global state of the user Inputs (keyboard/mouse), and to the Window via pointers.
	//    The controller doesn't own the camera matrix but only modifies the one passed as parameter in the action functions.
	//    Specialized camera controller can own a model of camera allowing to store intermediate states for internal computation.
	struct camera_controller_generic_base

		// Allow to activate/deactivate the camera
		bool is_active = true;

		// Assign the pointers of inputs and window to the global state
		// This method must be called at the initialization before any other action handling
