	/* Camera orbit represented using Euler angle with convention following (roll, pitch, yaw) angles.
	* The camera rotates around the point [center_of_rotation], at a distance [distance_to_center].
	* The orientation of the camera is parameterized by the angle roll, pitch, yaw: 
	*   The initial frame is oriented toward -z, and the rotations are 
	*   - roll: rotation around (0,0,-1)
	*   - pitch: rotation around (1,0,0) 
	*   - yaw: rotation around (0,1,0)
	*   - The final rotation is R = roll * pitch * yaw, 
	* In standard use, roll is not used, therefore the camera can be seen as a frame with center given as spherical coordinates (yaw, pitch), and always target the center point
	* 
	* The orbit takes place around a specific axis defined as +y by default (ex. to rotates around a terrain given as y=f(x,z)).
	* This axis is encoded in [axis_of_rotation] and can be changed at any time.
