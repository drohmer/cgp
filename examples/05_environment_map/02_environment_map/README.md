# Environment mapping

This code shows the use of environment (/reflection) mapping. A "Skybox" is displayed in the background = a cube with a seamless environment texture that follows the user. And the main shape is displayed with a reflective mapping (the normal of the shape indicates which part of the texture is displayed).
